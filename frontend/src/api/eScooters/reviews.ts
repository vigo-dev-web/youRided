			'Этот самокат принес моим мальчикам часы веселья. Очень легко вставить в розетку и зарядить, и после этого они отправились кататься по району. Моим детям 8 и 11 лет, и они оба смогли кататься и получить удовольствие. У меня также есть сын, которому 16 лет, и он тоже попробовал его, и этот электросмокат все равно смог его выдержать, даже несмотря на то, что его вес превышает предельный. Он крепкий и надежный, очень хорошо сделан. Управлять им очень легко. Теперь проблема в том, что нам нужен ещё один, потому что мои мальчики не хотят делиться.',
			'Этот очень спортивный и внешне экстремальный скутер - скутер всех скутеров! Моему сыну, которому 8 лет, этот самокат очень понравился. Время работы от батареи составляет более полутора часов при постоянной езде. Этот электросамокат приносит столько радости моему сыну. Он мотивирует его вставать и выходить на улицу, вместо того чтобы играть в видеоигры.',
			'Мне бесплатно отправили Razor E90 для тестирования. Мой 9-летний ребенок сразу смог на нем кататься без проблем. Моим 7-летним детям пришлось немного постараться, потому что для запуска мотора нужно разогнаться хотя бы до 5 км/час. Возрастное ограничение указано с 8 лет и старше. Но всем троим они очень нравятся. Он очень хорошо сделан, прочный и надежный. Очень рекомендую своим друзьям.'

			'This has provided hours of fun for my boys. It was very easy to just plug in and charge and then they were off around the neighborhood. My boys are 8 and 11 and they both were able to ride and have a blast with this. I also have 2 sons who are 16 and they had to try it out and it still was able to hold them even with their weight being over the limit. It is strong and sturdy and very well made. It is very easy to control and a smooth ride. Now the issue is getting another one because my boys do not want to share.',
			"This very sporty yet extreme looking scooter is the scooters of all scooters!! My son who is 8 years old absolutely loves this scooter. The battery life lasts over a half hour running consistently. This scooter has brought so much joy to my son. It motivated him to get up and go outside instead of playing video games. He has an absolute blast every single time he rides. It also helps myself and his other siblings to be more active. Over other scooter we have tried this one takes the cake. From the long lasting battery, speed and safety I couldn't be happier. I will be recommending this exact scooter to anyone thats asks about it. Can't beat a scooter the kids will love and promotes being active and outside.",
			"I was sent the Razor E90 free of charge for testing purposes. I've got 3 younger children. 8 and 7 year old twins. My 8 year old was able to jump on and use it with no trouble at all. My 7 year olds had just a tiny bit of trouble because you need to get it going at least 3mph before the motor will catch and work. The age range is 8 and up so I cant be upset with that. They all three love it though. It's very well built, solid and sturdy. Would totally recommend to my friends and family!!"
